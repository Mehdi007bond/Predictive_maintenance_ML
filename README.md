# ML Predictive Maintenance

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on **Predictive Maintenance**, which aims to forecast equipment failures before they occur. The goal is to optimize maintenance schedules, reduce downtime, and enhance operational efficiency using data-driven models.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning pipelines
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visual insights
- Feature engineering for sensor and operational data
- Implementation of various ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, etc.)
- Model evaluation metrics including F1-score, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- Visualization of predictive performance and maintenance scheduling

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mehdi007bond/Predictive_maintenance_ML.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Predictive_maintenance_ML
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your data and place it in the `data/` folder.
2. Run preprocessing and feature extraction scripts:
   ```bash
   python src/preprocess.py
   ```
3. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python src/train.py
   ```
4. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python src/evaluate.py
   ```
